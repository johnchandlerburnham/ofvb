# 15: The OCaml Standard Library

[See `standard.ml`](/15/standard.ml)

Street's Core library. Maybe that's something to investigate after I finish this
book.

## Questions

### 1
Didn't we do this in Chapter 4?

### 6

So apparently `List.iter` and `List.map` do the same thing here, except the
latter throws a warning.

### 7

This is a bad way to do parsing. A Parsec, a Parsec, my kingdom for a Parsec!
